=========

A JavaScript web worker for encoding PNGs. Send it the raw pixel data from a Canvas element (perhaps via [transferable objects] (http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast)), and it'll send back the raw PNG data.

`deflate.js` is from [Zip.JS](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js).
